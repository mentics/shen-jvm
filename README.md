Shen to JVM bytecode compiler

This is an old project I made to compile Shen Lisp to JVM bytecode. After this, I worked on compiling to Java source code in: https://github.com/mentics/shen-on-java

Generally, the code here is released under the Apache license except anything required under the Shen license: http://www.shenlanguage.org/

Libraries under the lib dir are under their respective licenses.
